Lcapy is an experimental Python package for teaching linear circuit
analysis.  It uses SymPy for symbolic mathematics.

Lcapy can analyse circuits described with netlists using modified
nodal analysis.

Alternatively, Lcapy can analyse networks and circuits formed by
combining one, two, and (some) three port networks.


Circuit analysis
----------------

The circuit is described using netlists, similar to SPICE, with
arbitrary node names (except for the ground node which is labelled 0).
The netlists can be loaded from a file or created at run-time.  For
example:

   >>> from lcapy import Circuit
   >>> cct = Circuit('Voltage divider')
   >>> cct.add('V_s fred 0') 
   >>> cct.add('R_a fred 1') 
   >>> cct.add('R_b 1 0') 
   >>> cct.V[1].pprint()
   >>> cct.V['fred'].pprint()
   >>> cct.I['R_a'].pprint()
   >>> cct.Vd['R_a'].pprint()


One-port networks
-----------------

One-port networks can be created by series and parallel combinations
of other one-port networks.  The primitive one-port networks are the
following ideal components:

V independent voltage source
I independent current source
R resistor
C capacitor
L inductor

These components are converted to s-domain models and so capacitor and
inductor components can be specified with initial voltage and
currents, respectively, to model transient responses.

The components are represented by either Thevenin or Norton one-port
networks with the following attributes:

Zoc open-circuit impedance
Ysc short-circuit admittance
Voc open-circuit voltage
Isc short-circuit current

The component values can be specified numerically or symbolically
using strings, for example,

from lcapy import Vdc, R, L, C

   >>> R1 = R('R_1') 
   >>> L1 = L('L_1')
   >>> a = Vdc(10) + R1 + L1

Here a is the name of the network formed with a 10 V DC voltage source in
series with R1 and L1.

The open circuit voltage across the network can be printed with:
   >>> print(a.Voc)
   10/s

The time domain response is given by:
   >>> print(a.Voc.transientresponse())
   10*Heaviside(t)

The short circuit current through the network can be printed with:
   >>> print(a.Isc)
   10/(L_1*s**2 + R_1*s)

The time domain response is given by:
   >>> print(a.Isc.transientresponse())
   10*Heaviside(t)/R_1 - 10*exp(-R_1*t/L_1)*Heaviside(t)/R_1


Two-port networks
-----------------

One-port networks can be combined to form two-port networks.  Methods
are provided to determine transfer responses between the ports.

Here's an example of creating a voltage divider (L section)

   >>> a = LSection(R('R_1'), R('R_2'))


Limitations
-----------

1. Non-linear components cannot be modelled (apart from a linearisation around a bias point).

2. High order systems can go crazy.

3. Some two-ports generate singular matrices.


Schematics
----------

LaTeX schematics can be generated using circuitikz and the Schematic
class.  Currently, this is independent from Lcapy but uses a similar
netlist syntax but with additional drawing hints, such as direction
and size.

   >>> from lcapy import Schematic
   >>> sch = Schematic()
   >>> sch.add('P1 1 0.1; down')
   >>> sch.add('R1 3 1; right')
   >>> sch.add('L1 2 3; right')
   >>> sch.add('C1 3 0; down')
   >>> sch.add('P2 2 0.2; down')
   >>> sch.add('W 0 0.1; right')
   >>> sch.add('W 0.2 0.2; right')
   >>> sch.draw(filename='pic.tex')

In this example, P denotes a port (open-circuit) and W denotes a wire
(short-circuit).  The drawing hints are separated from the netlist
arguments by a semicolon.  They are a comma separated list of
key-value pairs except for directions where the dir keyword is
optional.  The symbol label can be changed using the l keyword; the
voltage and current labels are specified with the v and i keywords.
For example,

   >>> from lcapy import Schematic
   >>> sch = Schematic()
   >>> sch.add('V1 1 0; down')
   >>> sch.add('R1 1 2; left, i=I_1, v=V_{R_1}')
   >>> sch.add('R2 1 3; right, i=I_2, v=V_{R_2}')
   >>> sch.add('L1 2 0.1; down, i=I_1, v=V_{L_1}')
   >>> sch.add('L2 3 0.3; down, i=I_1, v=V_{L_2}')
   >>> sch.add('W 0 0.3; right')
   >>> sch.add('W 0 0.1; left')
   >>> sch.draw(scale=3, filename='pic2.tex')

The drawing direction is with respect to the positive node; i.e., the
drawing is performed from the positive to the negative node.  Since
lower voltages are usually lower in a schematic, then the direction of
voltage sources and ports is usually down.

By default, component (and current) labels are drawn above horizontal
components and to the right of vertical components.  Voltage labels
are drawn below horizontal components and to the left of vertical
components.

Node names containing a dot or underscore are not displayed.
