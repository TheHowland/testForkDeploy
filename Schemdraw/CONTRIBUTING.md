Report bugs and feature requests on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/cdelker/schemdraw/issues).

Code contributions are welcome, especially with new circuit elements (and we'd be happy to expand beyond electrical elements too). To contribute code, please fork the [source code repository](https://github.com/cdelker/schemdraw/) and issue a pull request. Make sure to include any new elements somewhere in the test Jupyter notebooks and in the documentation.
